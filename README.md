- Coordinating deliverables between developers, designers, and stakeholders  
- Managing timelines using Agile tools like Jira and Trello  
- Driving outcomes through clear communication and structured planning  

This portfolio serves as both a reflection of my work and an example of how I approach project presentation, clarity, and execution.
